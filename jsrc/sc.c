 // The possibilities are:
 // 1. nothing (most likely) - we called a simple name and it returned
 // 2. just a CALLSTACKPOPLOCALE - we called a locative and it returned.  We have to restore the implied locale, which was saved on the stack
 // 3. 18!:4 puts a CALLSTACKPOPFROM entry giving the implied locale before the switch.  We expect that 18!:4 is called through a cover name and if we see it on the stack we
 //   suppress restoring the global locale when the current name (which must be the cover name) completes.  But, we have to make sure that the previous name, which
 //   might not have had any stack entry at all, knows to reset the implied locales when IT finishes.  [The problem is that there might be a string of calls with nothing on the stack,
 //   and then the 18!:4, and you need a marker to indicate which call the 18!:4 applies to.]  So, at the very end, we put a CALLSTACKPOPLOCALEFIRST entry into the
 //   CALLER's stack to notify it of what its starting locale was.  But there is a further mess: there might be oodles of calls to 18!:4 is a row, and if each one pushes CALLSTACKPOPLOCALEFIRST into
 //   its caller, the stack will overflow.  To prevent this, when we push the CALLSTACKPOPLOCALEFIRST onto the caller's stack we enter a new mode, wherein EVERY call starts with
 //   POPLOCALE.  Now there is no ambiguity about where the 18!:4 applies, and we can simply remove them as they come up.
 // 4. u./v. pushes CALLSTACKPUSHLOCALSYMS to save the LOCAL symbol table.  It overrides any other locale resetting above, is always first, and is always followd by CALLSTACKPOPLOCALE
 //
 // We also handle deletion of locales as they leave execution.  Locales cannot be deleted while they are pointed to by paths.  The AC is used to see when there are
 // no references to a locale, as usual; but if the locale has been marked for deletion and is no longer running, it is half-deleted, losing its path and all its symbols,
 // and exists as a zombie until its path references disappear.  To tell is a locale is running, we use a separate 'execution count' stored in AR, which is like a low-order extension
 // of AC.  When a locale is created, it is given usecount of 1 and execution count of 1.  When it is deleted, the execution count is decremented and if it is decremented to 0, that
 // causes the locale to be half-deleted and the AC decremented, possibly resulting in deletion of the locale.  [A flag prevents half-deletion of the locale more than once.]
 // To prevent half-deletion while the locale is running, we increment the execution count when an execution (including the first) switches into the locale, and decrement the
 // execution count when that execution completes (either by a switch back to the previous locale or a successive 18!:4).
 // scaf AR is only 8 bits; if we call back & forth between 2 locales we could overflow the count at a call depth of 512.  Should have a longer count field, perhaps using 2 bytes starting at AR.
 //
 // Locale switches through 18!:4 take advantage of the fact that the cover verb does nothing except the 18!:4 function and thus cannot alter locales itself.
 // The 18!:4 is treated as the start of a new execution for execution-count purposes, and always ensures that the last thing in the caller's stack is either CALLSTACKPOPLOCALEFIRST (for the
 // very first 18!:4) or CALLSTACKCHANGELOCALE (for others).  When 18!:4 is executed, if the caller's stack ends with POPFIRST or CHANGELOCALE, that must mean that the 18!:4 being executed
 // must be the second one in that name, and therefore the execution-count of the current locale is decremented.  Likewise, when a name finishes with POPFIRST or CHANGELOCALE on the top of its own stack,
 // it knows that it executed 18!:4 and must decrement the current locale.  In all cases decrementing the locale count for the locale that the name started with is done only
 // when processing a POP returning from a locative, but if there is a POPFIRST/POPFROM in the frame, the locale that is decremented must be the one in the POPFIRST/CHANGELOCALE (and also
 // the locale in the POPFIRST/CHANGELOCALE must be from the FIRST 18!:4 which will give the starting locale, though we could equally take this value from explocale)
 //
